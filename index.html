      <p>The purpose of this site is to give you an idea of where I am on my journey as a developer. This site showcases all the skills I have learned in web development through the C1 course. My mission is to make this site as neat and advanced as I can possibly make it, and to have something I can be proud of by the end of the course.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p>On this site you will find an About Me section that showcases more information about myself. You will also find a section where I write a blog about my journey and everything I learn along the way. These sections let you know more about my life, and what I have accomplished both in this class and beyond.</p>
      <p>To navigate the site, I have provided a series of buttons in the header, along with a search bar to find specific elements. The header of this page will let you return to the home page, look at the projects I have completed, learn more about me and this site, and answer some questions you might have. You can also choose to share this site on several social media sites using the icons in the upper right corner. In the footer of the page, you can choose to subscribe to this page using your contact information.</p>

Up until now, I had been stuck in the warehouse at Amazon, until I decided to take an IT suppport class through career choice in 2022. That class, from Merit America, was my first dip into the tech world, and I wanted to go further by applying to the Amazon Technical Academy Software Development program. Unfortunately I was unable to make it into such a competetive program, but taking the precourse for that program allowed me to find an interest in software development. That failure was the main driving factor into why I chose C1 to continue my learning. Finished Project 1.</p>
